# Description 
Code and tech for [GovHack 2018, Canberra](https://2018.hackerspace.govhack.org/events/canberra_australian_capital_territory).

# Project Introduction 
According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics 2016 Census, the Australian population is ageing, with the proportion of people over 65 years has steadily increased over the last century.

Councils, governments, and private enterprises need to adapt to the changing populations - but where do they start? How can we predict where to build or expand the appropriate infrastructure (e.g. bus stops) and services (e.g. hospitals) in preparation?

The Age-Friendly Planning Tool maps government data on population projections for the Canberra region and assists users in identifying areas requiring increased support and development, now and into the future.

The intended users of our tool are town planners, government and private enterprises, and potentially even older Canberrans.

Our tool maps data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare on ageing population predictions and data from the Department of Health on current aged care services for Canberra to help understand what areas may require age-friendly resources and infrastructure.  It also combines local ACT Government data on bus stop locations to identify where additional stops may be needed to support older residents who rely on public transport. 

The age friendly planning tool exposes a visualisation front-end on both desktops and mobile. It relies on an analytics backend that does data processing and storage up in the cloud. This architecture enables flexibility and mobility on the part of the user and allows the system to scale for higher performance.

The intention of our project is to demonstrate how a range of government data could be combined to predict and support the needs of older Canberrans. In addition to the data sets we have used, additional government such as data on footpaths, pedestrian crashes, hospitals and health care facilities could be included to better identify all areas of development in preparation for aging populations. Our mapping tool could be expanded on a larger geographic scale to encourage a whole-of-government collaborative approach across Australia. 

# Data Story

According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2016 Census, the Australian population is ageing, with the proportion of people over 65 steadily increasing over the last century. 
As we age, our housing, transport and social needs change. Areas with more older residents may require additional resources that are often only identified only after residents experience hardship. 
We spoke to Lucy who volunteers at Villaggio Saint Antonio’s, an Aged care facility, who told us that the footpaths in the area are too narrow and the residents can’t walk side by side or use their mobility scooters. Many parks and community spaces in the area also have poor wheelchair accessibility. This discourages residents from exercising and socialising with friends outdoors. Our tool can help plan for these issues in advance.
Our tool will help town planners, government and private enterprise plan how to make Canberra more inclusive for older Canberrans. The tool combines population projections with health, services and infrastructure data to identify areas requiring increased support and development, now and into the future.
Our tool maps ageing population predictions data and current aged care services data for Canberra to help understand what areas will require age-friendly resources and infrastructure.  It also combines local ACT Government data on bus stop locations to identify where additional bus stops may be needed to support older residents. 
A private business could use the tool to plan the location of its next aged care residence by cross-referencing population projections with location of current facilities. In addition, the ACT government could also use the tool to identify areas where facilities (such as footpaths, bus stops and medical centres) need to be upgraded to better support the changing community. In this way, the tool can help improve the quality of life of residents such as those in St Antonios.
Over time this concept could be expanded to include a plethora of recreational, health, education, etc. services on a national level to encourage a collaborative national approach to supporting an ageing population, and empower senior residents to make choices based on this information.

Dataset 1
Name: Population projections, 2012 (base) to 2027 for all states and territories at Statistical Area Level 2 (SA2) by sex and age
Source: Found using data.gov.au, authored by ABS
Description of Use: This data set was used as the basis of the mapping tool's year-on-year population projections in ACT, by suburb, and for those aged 65 and over.

Dataset 2
Name: Aged care services list
Source: Found using AIHW website, authored by Department of Health
Description of Use: This dataset was used in the mapping tool to map current locations of various aged care services, and to identify gaps where they can be placed in the future based on population projections.

Dataset 3
Name: Bus stops in the ACT
Source: Found using Open Data Portal dataACT, authored by Transport Canberra and City Services
Description of Use: This dataset was used on the mapping tool to map current locations of bus stops, and to identify gaps where bus stops can be placed in the future based on population projections.

Dataset 4
Name: Public furniture in the ACT
Source: Found using Open Data Portal dataACT, authored by Transport Canberra and City Services
Description of Use: This dataset was used on the mapping tool to map current locations of public furniture, and to identify gaps where they can be placed in the future based on population projections.
