# Description 
Code and tech for [GovHack 2018, Canberra](https://2018.hackerspace.govhack.org/events/canberra_australian_capital_territory).

# Project Introduction 
According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics 2016 Census, the Australian population is ageing, with the proportion of people over 65 years has steadily increased over the last century.

Councils, governments, and private enterprises need to adapt to the changing populations - but where do they start? How can we predict where to build or expand the appropriate infrastructure (e.g. bus stops) and services (e.g. hospitals) in preparation?

This app draws together ageing population predictions for the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) in addition to the existing facilities and services important to this population cohort. With this data in one accessible place, councils, planners and businesses can identify where services are needed most and senior residents can make decisions accordingly.

Over time this concept could be expanded to include a plethora of recreational, health, education, etc. services on a national level to encourage a collaborative national approach to supporting an ageing population, and empower senior residents to make choices based on this information.
